# `internet-speed`

This is a simple project used to monitor the internet speed. When `main.py` is run, it will run a speed test of the download and upload speeds, save them to a file in `data/speed_tests.txt` (appending if it already exists) and uploading it a file on Dropbox.

The code [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36851978/1102199) and guide [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23895259/1102199) were useful to me in figuring out how to connect with Dropbox.
